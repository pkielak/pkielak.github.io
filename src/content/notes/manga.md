So far I managed to read:

- Naruto\
I read this as a teenager, and I was strongly identifying with the main character. This series introduced me to the habit of reading manga, but after finishing this series I did not continue this passion. Until...

- One Punch Man\
The character of OPM intrigued me when I saw memes and videos with him. Finally, I started by watching anime. Watching the first season of the anime series, made me want to know more about this world. Absurd and brilliant, for sure.

- Black Lagoon\
In this case, I also started with anime. Empathetic characters, are a nice addition to the fast-paced action. I liked the references to the action movies of the 90s.

- Pluto\
The first manga I read after a long break. A combination of cyberpunk motives and a detective story - a thing characteristic of Naoki Urasawa's work.

- Monster\
A trivial starting idea in the form of a medical/psychological thriller may not be repulsive and be just a good manga book.

- Akira\
A story much deeper than the one told in the anime. A must see.

- Ikigami\
A series read during a break from Akira. Something for fans of the dystopia motif. Very engaging.

- Apollo's Song\
I read Pluto based on Osamu Tezuka's The Greatest Robot on Earth and wanted to reach for one of the mangas by this author. I chose Apollo's Song because of its availability in the library. When you break through the characteristic style, which may not suit everyone, you get a moving story about the emotions of a young man.

- Blame!\
A story of a journey through the endless expanses of a megastructure, sparing in words but not in means. Very absorbing.

- Abara\
Another manga by Tsutomu Nihei, that I read. Didn't disappoint me and was just as good as Blame!

- Ajin\
A decent manga in the style of Death Note (I admit that I've only watched the anime, maybe someday I'll catch up and read the manga).

- Knights of Sidonia\
This is yet another work by Tsutomu Nihei. I like this manga author. This manga is more mainstream (mecha genre) than other of his works, but still, the art is great and the plot is quite good, with likable characters.

- My Lesbian Experience with Loneliness\
This is manga not about sex, but about mental illness, it's quite a good read.

- All You Need Is Kill\
I stumbled upon this in the library. I had nice memories of the film adaptation (Edge of Tomorrow, with Tom Cruise BTW) of the novel, so I borrowed the manga adaptation to compare. It's quite good, but not amazing, definitely for fans of this type of story (Groundhog Day type of story). 

I am currently reading:
- 20th Century Boys (8 out of 11 books)
- Death Note (3 out of 11 books)
