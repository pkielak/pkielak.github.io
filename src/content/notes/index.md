This garden will grow in the future, and I have many plans for each specific section. On this page, I will summarize what the garden is and what it will be in the future. For now, I will just list the sections.

This garden is divided into these categories:
- [[dev|development]] - a place for texts about development-related stuff
- [[hobby]] - a place where I write about my hobbies
- [[accolades]] - my thanks to the projects that helped me set up this site
- [[todo|things to be done]] - things to be done in this digital garden
