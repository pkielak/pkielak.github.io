So as the title says, this note is about my music listening gear. As for now, I have:
- Truthear Hola - My only IEMs right now, they're indestructible and have good sound.
- Philips X2HR is the only open-back headphone set that I have. I'll sell them soon because right now, there are too many headphones for me, and they lack some clarity in the midrange.
- Shure SRH440 - I always wanted some headphones that are tuned close to the Harman curve. Bargain buy. I just renovated them.
- Brainwavz HM5 - I dreamed about them for a long time, and now I've bought them cheap. They only need some TLC to shine again.

In the near future I also will have KZ AM01, my first dongle DAC and I hope this'll be decent sound device.

I had in the past:
- iPod Mini 2g - Dead battery/motherboard. :(
- Sennheiser HD560s - I had them for a while. They were perfect, but they had horrible channel imbalance and I returned them and bought X2HRs.
- Encore RockMaster OE - A decent pair of gaming headphones.
- Brainwavz HM3 - They were good for their price.
- Many IEMs that didn't survive long.
- AKG K414p - My first proper headphones. I repaired them many times and they served me well.
- Sansa Fuze 1gen - I had Rockbox installed on this, and It was superb for its times.
- Creative Muvo Micro - One of the first MP3 players that I had.
