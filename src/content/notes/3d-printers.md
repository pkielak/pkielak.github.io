I am interested in 3D printers. The lack of time and space for them made me buy some crappy printers along the way. But I'm trying to do something with this what I got.

- Made a list of easy printing [[filaments]]. One day I'll check them all.
- Sold Easythreed Nano, I didn't have time for this one.
- I destroyed the hotend of my Weedo Tina 2s I need to find a replacement, maybe a clone of e3d v6, with some modifications of the hotend carriage. 
- I just bought Kingroon KP3S (this first one) and upgraded the firmware to Marlin straightaway, the original one had issues with the extruder not moving after a few seconds of print.
